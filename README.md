# SetupInstall-Universal
Its currently the, latest and best, version of my `Setup-Install.Bat`, made to work on any requirements.txt.

### DESCRIPTION:
- I dont have endless amounts of hard-drive space, with the models and my games, and my videos, it becomes a juggling act, so you better believe I am not using environments for python, endless mirrors of already installed packaged, some individually 2.5GB, hence, I try and spread my applications across versions of python, and hope they dont break each other too much, like normal people do, well, me. Thus, here is a Universal Setup-Install, that will install requirements at the click of a button, for any python application. 

### Install And Use:
1. Download and unpack to the same Directory as the `requirements.txt`.
2. Edit this line `set "PYTHON_VERSION_NODECIMAL=310"` to have the version relevant to the program the `requirements.txt` relates to (eg. 311 for version 3.11).
3. Run `Setup-Install.Bat`, and take a look at the output.
- Ensure you ignore any dependency compatibility issues, if they are not for the SPECIFIC VERSION of the SPECIFIC PROGRAM, that you are using.
